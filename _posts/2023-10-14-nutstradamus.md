For our final project in UC Berkeley's CS61B (Data Structures and Algorithms), my friend Evan Pfeifer and I were tasked with building an arcade game essentially from scratch using Java. We were given a free hand for the design and implementation components and provided with only an engine to render tiles.

In our game, you play as Nutstradamus, a squirrel philosopher who must collect enough acorns to reach enlightenment. However, he must evade a pack of hungry dogs who relentlessly track him down; if you are caught by the dogs before collecting all the acorns, you fail to reach enlightenment and lose the game.
