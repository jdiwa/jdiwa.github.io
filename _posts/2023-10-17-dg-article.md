The year is 1979. The US Pioneer 11 space probe has just passed Saturn and the Knack’s “My Sharona” sits comfortably atop the Billboard charts. A little-known trio from Englewood, New Jersey who call themselves The Sugarhill Gang are about to release their new single, based on a freestyle they performed over the instrumental from Chic’s “Good Times”; they decide to title it “Rapper’s Delight”. This is the birth of hip hop.

Hip hop’s roots are firmly embedded in counterculture. Hip hop gained traction early on by serving as a loudspeaker that downtrodden Black Americans could use to amplify their voices and speak out against overwhelming systemic repression. The outright aggression of early acts like N.W.A. and Public Enemy stood in stark contrast to the synth-heavy, dancy sounds of contemporary pop as they spoke truth to power on cuts like “Fuck Tha Police” and “Black Steel in The Hour of Chaos”. As a result, hip hop was and often still is demonized by political commentators who speculate that hip hop “has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years” as well as old-head music fans who opine that it lacks respectability and decry hip hop artists as talentless hacks.

Fast forward to today. Hip hop is the soundtrack to soda commercials featuring pro athletes; Travis Scott has his own McDonalds meal; high schoolers put their raps on Soundcloud, hoping to hit it big; fans congregate in enormous numbers across social media to discuss their rabid anticipation for release dates and drop hot takes. Hip hop has well and truly taken over the mainstream, and its sound has shifted accordingly: the advent of digital tools fundamentally changed hip hop’s approach to production, as early regional styles like boom bap and G-funk gave way to sample-heavy bling era opulence and eventually bombastic trap music with its trademark adlibs and heavy snares. However, as hip hop gained cultural acceptance, it also lost its edge: even though rappers continued telling real stories about gang warfare and life on the streets, their music was readily co-opted by mainstream culture in spite of its subject matter because of its catchy hooks and danceable rhythms. As Andrew Callaghan, one of the original man-on-the-street interview trendsetters and host of Channel 5 puts it, “before you knew it, white America was doing the hokey pokey to murder music”. Hip hop’s seriousness was undercut by the accessible appeal of the proverbial banger, and sociopolitical messaging gave way to the proven songwriting formulas and consistent output of mainstream hip hop’s hit machines like Drake or Migos. However, many modern hip hop artists are still focused on innovation and search for creative ways to use digital tools to create entirely new sounds. The advent of technology has changed the world we live in drastically in the 43 years since the Sugarhill Gang dropped “Rapper’s Delight”, with ever more sinister forms of digital repression alongside exciting new forms of musical expression. Experimental hip hop is one of the newest forms of musical counterculture, and the artist who might best exemplify the genre is Death Grips.

Death Grips is anything but mainstream. Among other things, they were dropped from their Epic label deal for leaking their own album (where the cover art was the drummer’s erect penis) over a release date dispute. They are unapologetically and unequivocally confrontational and their music reflects that fact: it is intentionally abrasive, seemingly assembled slipshod from clashing, discordant tones and off-kilter, layered samples. However, their complete disregard for hip hop trends and tendency towards noise, distortion, and open hostility has made them new-age hip hop counterculture icons. “Hacker”, the closing track to their magnum opus The Money Store, is Death Grips’ special form of satire and social critique at its most effective. MC Ride plays the part of a dispassionate hacker, performing digital-age smash-and-grabs behind the anonymity of a computer screen. The chanted chorus reminds the listener that they live under constant threat; regardless of his physical location, the eponymous hacker knows the “first three numbers” of your area code are only a few keystrokes away, and he can be “in your area” anytime and anywhere. The combination of Ride’s uniquely impassioned, shouty delivery and driving, anxious synths adds desperation and urgency to every line, even though his cryptic lyrics are largely inscrutable. Throughout the song, Ride name drops the Apple Store, Lady Gaga and Wikileaks alongside a constant stream of technological jargon and veiled threats of digital violence – “Neo-reality”, “you’ll catch a jpeg to the head”. This esoteric diction interspersed with the occasional pop culture reference works in tandem with Flatlander’s shifting, glitchy production to replicate the information overload we feel on a daily basis, a side effect of the 24-hour news cycle and being permanently online: all meaning is lost in the nonstop verbal barrage and the listener is left confused and disoriented.  “Hacker” depicts the absurdity and paranoia of the modern age from the perspective of an outsider lurking in the shadows: even at ten years of age, Death Grips’ scorching diatribe against an encroaching digital dystopia still resonates deeply with the world we live in today.
